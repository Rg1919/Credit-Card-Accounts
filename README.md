# Credit Card Accounts Project

## Overview

This project involves analyzing and visualizing credit card account data to gain valuable insights for better business decisions. The initial data is sourced from an Excel file containing columns such as CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, EstimatedSalary, CardType, and Points Earned. The data is imported into MySQL for further processing and cleaning. Once the data is cleaned and prepared, it is exported to Power BI to create a comprehensive report.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Import**: The initial dataset is sourced from an Excel file and imported into MySQL for data processing.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Perform data cleaning and data transformation tasks in MySQL to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

3. **Data Analysis**: Utilize MySQL queries to perform insightful analysis on customer demographics, credit scores, product usage, and rewards earned.

4. **Data Export**: Export the cleaned and analyzed data from MySQL to Power BI for visualization.

5. **Power BI Report**: Create a comprehensive Power BI report to visualize the credit card account insights, including charts, graphs, and tables.

## Power BI Report

The Power BI report (`CreditCardAccounts.pbix`) showcases various insights and visualizations derived from the cleaned and analyzed credit card account data. It presents a clear view of customer demographics, credit scores, product usage, and reward patterns. The report aims to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions and gain a better understanding of their credit card business.

## Conclusion

This project offers a comprehensive analysis of credit card account data through MySQL and Power BI. The combination of data processing, cleaning, analysis, and visualization allows stakeholders to gain valuable insights for informed decision-making, enhancing customer experience and business performance.
